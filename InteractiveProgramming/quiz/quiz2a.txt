Question 4
For the SimpleGUI-based programs in this course, we recommended breaking down an interactive Python program into seven parts. Below, these parts are listed alphabetically.

Create frame
Define classes
Define event handlers
Initialize global variables
Define helper functions
Register event handlers
Start frame and timers
However, in lecture, we recommended a particular ordering of these parts. Enter 7 numbers in the range 1–7, separated only by spaces, to indicate the recommended ordering of the preceding elements of an interactive Python program. For example, if you think that the first action in your program should be to register your event handlers, enter 6 as the first number in the sequence.

Question 5
Assume the following global definition is part of your program.

x = 5
If each of the following function definitions are also part of your program, which of them needs a global x declaration? You can try each definition in CodeSkulptor.

Your Answer		Score	Explanation

def c(y):
    return x + y
Correct	1.50	
This example does not need a global declaration. You don't need a global declaration unless you are assigning to the global variable.


def b(x,y):
    x = x + y
    return x
Correct	1.50	
This example does not need a global declaration. Here a local variable x is being assigned to. If you add a global declaration, you'll get a SyntaxError.


def d(y):
    y = x + y
    return y
Correct	1.50	
This example does not need a global declaration. You don't need a global declaration unless you are assigning to the global variable.


def a(y):
    x = x + y
    return y
Correct	5.50	
This example needs a global declaration. A global variable is assigned within a function, so you need a global declaration.

Question 6
Consider the following code.

count = 0

def square(x):
    global count
    count += 1
    return x**2

print square(square(square(square(3))))
What is the value of count at the end? Enter a number. (You can double check your answer in CodeSkulptor if you wish.)

Question 9
Which of the following are valid calls to create_frame?

Look at the documentation for SimpleGUI frames, but also try the code in CodeSkulptor.

Your Answer		Score	Explanation
f = simplegui.create_frame("My Frame", 100, 100)	Correct	4.00	
frame = simplegui.create_frame("My Frame", 200, 200, 200, 200)	Correct	1.00	
This is not a valid call. The call has too many arguments.

frame = simplegui.create_frame(100, 100, 100)	Correct	1.00	
This is not a valid call. The call is missing title argument.

frame = simplegui.create_frame("Testing", 200, 200, 300)	Correct	4.00
