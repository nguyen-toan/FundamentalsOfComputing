Question 1
What is the position of the center of the top-left card (Ace of Clubs, A♣) in the tiled image discussed in the "Tiled images" video? Remember that each card in this tiled image has size 73 x 98 pixels.

(Note that the tiled image used in the current version of your Blackjack mini-project is slightly smaller.)

Question 2
What is the position of the center of the bottom-right card (King of Diamonds, K♦) in the tiled image discussed in the "Tiled images" video? Again, remember that each card in this tiled image has size 73 x 98 pixels.

Question Explanation

Here are some hidden details to explain this potentially confusing behavior. Each Python class has a hidden constructor method that

constructs (makes) the object,
calls __init__ to initialize the object,
then returns this object.
So, while there is a return statement somewhere, it is in this hidden constructor method that you don't have to define.

Question 5
One way of understanding code is to think about other code that accomplishes the same thing — i.e., given the same starting values, it returns and/or mutates the same values.

This following defines one way to concatenate multiple lists. For example, list_extend_many([[1,2], [3], [4, 5, 6], [7]]) returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and doesn't mutate anything.

def list_extend_many(lists):
    """Returns a list that is the concatenation of all the lists in the given list-of-lists."""
    result = []
    for l in lists:
        result.extend(l)
    return result
Which of the following definitions are equivalent? I.e., which always produce the same output for the same input, and never mutate the input or any global variable?

Your Answer		Score	Explanation

def list_extend_many(lists):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(lists)):
        result.extend(lists[i])
    return result
Correct	4.00	
We can also loop over indices.


def list_extend_many(lists):
    result = []
    while len(lists) > 0:
        result.extend(lists.pop(0))
    return result
Correct	1.00	
This returns the correct result, but it mutates the argument in the process! So, if you have some code like the following:

lists = [[1 2], [3], [4, 5, 6], [7]]
print list_extend_many(lists)
print lists
It would show that lists is empty at the end.


def list_extend_many(lists):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(lists) - 1, -1, -1):
        result.extend(lists[i])
    return result
Correct	1.00	
This loops over all the items in the list, but in the reverse order. Sometimes that is fine, but here it the result is in reversed.


def list_extend_many(lists):
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(lists): 
        result.extend(lists[i])
        i += 1
    return result

Question 6
Which of the following programs would never end if it weren't for CodeSkulptor's timeout? Assume no break or return statement is used in the elided loop bodies.

You might want to add a print statement to each loop to better understand the behavior.

my_list = …
for x in my_list:
    …     # Assume this doesn't mutate my_list.
Correct	1.00	

n = 1001

    …     # Assume this doesn't modify n.
    n -= 2
Correct	4.00	

n = 1000
while n > 0:
    …     # Assume this doesn't modify n.

Question 7
Convert the following English description into code.

Initialize n to be 1000. Initialize numbers to be a list of numbers from 2 to n, but not including n.
With results starting as the empty list, repeat the following as long as numbers contains any numbers.
Add the first number in numbers to the end of results.
Remove every number in numbers that is evenly divisible by (has no remainder when divided by) the number that you had just added to results.
How long is results?

To test your code, when n is instead 100, the length of results is 25.

Correct. This computes the primes less than n by a process known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

By the way, here's one way to write this:

n = 1000
numbers = range(2, n)
results = []

while numbers != []:
    results.append(numbers[0])
    numbers = [n for n in numbers if n % numbers[0] != 0]

print len(results)

Question 8
We can use loops to simulate natural processes over time. Write a program that calculates the populations of two kinds of “wumpuses” over time. At the beginning of year 1, there are 1000 slow wumpuses and 1 fast wumpus. This one fast wumpus is a new mutation. Not surprisingly, being fast gives it an advantage, as it can better escape from predators. Each year, each wumpus has one offspring. (We'll ignore the more realistic niceties of sexual reproduction, like distinguishing males and females.). There are no further mutations, so slow wumpuses beget slow wumpuses, and fast wumpuses beget fast wumpuses. Also, each year 40% of all slow wumpuses die each year, while only 30% of the fast wumpuses do.

So, at the beginning of year one there are 1000 slow wumpuses. Another 1000 slow wumpuses are born. But, 40% of these 2000 slow wumpuses die, leaving a total of 1200 at the end of year one. Meanwhile, in the same year, we begin with 1 fast wumpus, 1 more is born, and 30% of these die, leaving 1.4. (We'll also allow fractional populations, for simplicity.)

Beginning of Year	Slow Wumpuses	Fast Wumpuses
1	1000	1
2	1200	1.4
3	1440	1.96
…	…	…
Enter the first year in which the fast wumpuses outnumber the slow wumpuses. Remember that the table above shows the populations at the start of the year.
