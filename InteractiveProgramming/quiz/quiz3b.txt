Question 1
When the following code is executed, how many times is timer_handler called?

import simplegui

def timer_handler():
   …

timer = simplegui.create_timer(10, timer_handler)
timer.start()
The body of timer_handler isn't given, as it is irrelevant for this question. You may want to finish the code and run it before submitting your answer.

Question 2
You want a timer to create exactly 1000 events. Which of the following solutions are possible?

Your Answer		Score	Explanation

Have a global counter for the number of timer calls. Outside the timer handler, increment the counter. Outside the timer handler, check the count and possibly stop the timer.

Correct	1.00	
You can't count the timer calls outside of the handler.


Have a global counter for the number of timer calls. In the timer handler, increment the counter. In the timer handler, check the count and possibly stop the timer.

Correct	7.00	

Specify the number of timer events when creating the timer.

Correct	1.00	
There is no such option.


In the timer handler, have a local counter for the number of timer calls. In the timer handler, increment the counter. In the timer handler, check the count and possibly stop the timer.

Correct	1.00	
With a local counter, you'll forget the count between calls.

Question 3
How do you change the frequency of a running timer, either increasing or decreasing the frequency? E.g., in the code below, we want code at the question marks that changes the timer.

…
timer = simplegui.create_timer(1000, timer_handler)
timer.start()
…
???
Your Answer		Score	Explanation

Just run create_timer. It will change the timer.

timer = simplegui.create_timer(300, timer_handler)

Just use set_timer_interval.

timer.set_timer_interval(300)

Create and start the timer again.

timer = simplegui.create_timer(300, timer_handler)
timer.start()

You can't. But, you can stop this timer, and start a new one with a different frequency and same handler.

timer.stop()
timer = simplegui.create_timer(300, timer_handler)
timer.start()
Correct	10.00	
That we use the same variable timer is irrelevant. This is a new timer.

Question 7
The Python code below uses a timer to execute the function update() 10 times, computing a good approximation to a common mathematical function. Examine the code, and run it while varying the input value n.

What is the common name for what this computes?

# Mystery computation in Python
# Takes input n and computes output named result

import simplegui

# global state

result = 1
iteration = 0
max_iterations = 10

# helper functions

def init(start):
    """Initializes n."""
    global n
    n = start
    print "Input is", n
    
def get_next(current):
    """???  Part of mystery computation."""
    return 0.5 * (current + n / current)

# timer callback

def update():
    """???  Part of mystery computation."""
    global iteration, result
    iteration += 1
    # Stop iterating after max_iterations
    if iteration >= max_iterations:
        timer.stop()
        print "Output is", result
    else:
        result = get_next(result)

# register event handlers

timer = simplegui.create_timer(1, update)

# start program
init(13)
timer.start()

Question Explanation

Such a computation is more typically written using loops, which we haven't introduced yet in this course. However, this example illustrates timers and handler/callback functions and one possible use for them.
Question 8
Given any initial natural number, consider the sequence of numbers generated by repeatedly following the rule:

divide by two if the number is even or
multiply by 3 and add 1 if the number is odd.
The Collatz conjecture states that this sequence always terminates at 1. For example, the sequence generated by 23 is:

23, 70, 35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

Write a Python program that takes a global variable n and uses a timer callback to repeatedly apply the rule above to n. Use the code from the previous question as a template. I suggest that your code prints out the sequence of numbers generated by this rule. Run this program for n = 217. What is the largest number in the sequence generated by this starting value?

To test your code, starting at n = 23 generates a sequence with a maximum value of 160.

Again, such a computation is more typically written using loops, but this exercise is illustrating the usage of timers and callback functions.
Question 9
CodeSkulptor runs your Python code by converting it into Javascript when you click the "Run" button and then executing this Javascript in your web browser. Open this example and run the provided code. If the SimpleGUI frame is spawned as a separate window, you should see an animation of an explosion in the canvas for this frame. If the SimpleGUI frame is spawned as a separate tab on top of the existing window containing the code (as happens in some browser configurations), the animation will "freeze" and a single static image is displayed. (If the SimpleGUI frame spawns as a separate window, you can also cause the animation to freeze by opening a new tab on top of the code window.) 
As explained in the FAQ, what is the explanation for this behavior?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
Javascript and Python are incompatible languages. As a result, the Python in one tab can't run at the same time as the Javascript in the SimpleGUI frame.			
Modern browser don't support running Javascript in multiple windows simultaneously. This situation causes the animation to freeze.			
To save resources, modern browsers only execute the Javascript associated with the topmost tab of a window. The animation freezes since the code tab and its associated Javascript is no longer the topmost tab.	Correct	10.00	Correct. If your browser does happen to open a SimpleGUI frame as a new tab on top of the existing code tab, "pull" this tab off of the top of the current window to create a new separate window.
